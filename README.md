# Corona Visualiser

These are series of graphs which can be used to find about useful instincts about the coronavirus . I made some graphs with which you can play on different parameters and can find useful patterns.

## Work-Flow

* Requirement Analysis - (What type of plots will be best to get some useful instincts)
* DataGathering - Went theought the web to get data of corona patients on daily basis
* Data Cleaning - Data I got was very unordered so needed to order it in the way I needed and also contained many Nan Values
* Had to do a crash course on d3.js and also go through it's documentation.
* Nedded to clean my data , so had to learn the pandas library of python
* Used pandas and numpy for cleaning my data.
